A portfolio containing some code that Think First Marketing has worked on.

=========

Included in this portfolio are some coding examples from clients that our developers have worked with in the past. While some information has been scrubbed for the protection of the clients, the code should help demonstrate our programming style. 

<b>Do it right the first time </b>
      In the past, there had been instances in our system where we’ve done what’s probably not the best coding technique the first time because we were trying to meet a deadline or just get it done. Instead, we decided that the best thing to do was to just push through the issues with hack and slash approaches that have left us with code that is hard to maintain, and the next programmer down the line is going to have an impossible time with. Since then, we have started to do it right the first time, developing code that we can easily support and maintain. 

<b>Reusability is key </b>
	       We work with a number of clients that are very similar to the last. Thus, as we do development work, we are focused on writing code that we can use again and again. Thus, we focus on maintainability and testing, and at the same time, we are trying to make the code that we do write more and more generic so that it can be used again. In doing so, we can use the same trusted platform with the next client down the line. 

<b>Code should be as modular as possible</b>
(i.e.making a new application in Django rather than just adding another view or making sure that there are no string urls in Django templates) 

<b>Develop with the end in mind </b>


<b>Develop for the end user to have control</b>
Rather than cutting corners and simply hard-coding the values of text on the screen, we take the extra step finding out from the user what information they want to have control over so that they can change those moving forward.
